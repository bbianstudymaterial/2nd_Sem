     Problems wtih Pointers
1. Unintialized Pointer.
   int x = 10;
   int *p;
   a. p = &x; //Point some know values.
   b. p = (int *)0*5638;
   c. p = new int[5]; //Allocate some memory in heap.

2. Memory Leak
   When you are allocating memory after using that you must deallocate memory, if we don't deallocate it leads to memory leak , if it is done for more number of times we may run out of memory.
   delete[]P;
   p = NULL;
   or p = 0;
   or p = nullptr;

3. Dangling pointer.
   void main(){
    int *p = new int[5];
    ..
    ..
    fun(p);
    x cout<<*p; //the pointer is already deleted in the function, so now it is a Dangling pointer.
   }
   void fun(int *q){
    .
    .
    .
    delete[]q;
   }
